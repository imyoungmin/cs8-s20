## Problem 1: 2020 Is a Leap Year, Is It?

A leap year is a calendar year that contains an additional day added to keep the calendar year synchronized with 
the astronomical year.  Given an integer year, it is said to be a leap year if its multiple of 4, but if it is 
divisible by 100, it is also evenly divisible by 400.  For example, 2008 was a leap year, as well as 2000; 
nevertheless, 1900 was not a leap year because despite being a multiple of 4 and of 100, it is not a multiple of 400.

Write a program that reads in an integer year and ouputs whether it is a leap or common year.
