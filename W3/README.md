## Problem 1
Given a string *s* of length 5, write a function to determine if *s* is palindromic. 


## Problem 2
Consider a vending machine represented as a dictionary with candy items (represented by their names)
mapped to prices. The names of the candy items are also stored in *names*, a list of strings. 
Write a program which outputs all candy names and their prices in the following form. 

* The price of [*name*] is [*price*]

As the vending machine was not profitable enough, the administrators decided to up the prices
by 150%. Implement these changes to the dictionary mapping *names* to *prices*.

Test your code in both of the above questions by creating your own dictionaries and names.
