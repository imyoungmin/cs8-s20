'''
Write a program which takes 5 strings as inputs and appends them to a list l. Swap each element in l with its mirror - that is, for some element at index i, swap l[i] with l[4-i] if i < 3.

For instance, if l = ['Alex', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Ethan'], then after swapping, l should read
['Ethan', 'David', 'Charlie', 'Bob', 'Alex']

Finally, finish the program by creating a dictionary mapping each name to its length.
