# Introduction to Computer Science, Spring 2020

## Practice, Practice, Practice ... Repeat

Welcome to CS8, Introduction to Computer Science!  In this repository you will find exercises to practice during
our discussion sessions and on your own.  Practice problems are grouped in their corresponding folder.  In general,
you will find the exercises in the README file on each week folder (e.g. W2, W3, etc).  The solutions are also 
provided.  Try to solve these problems without looking at their solutions.  Then compare your results.

Happy coding!
