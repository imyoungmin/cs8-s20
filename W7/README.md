# Exercises for Week 7

## Problem 1: Linear Search

Write a function that receives a list and a query number as inputs, and returns the indices in the input 
list where the query number is found.  If the number doesn't exist in the list, the function should 
return an empty list.

## Problem 2: In Place Reversion

Write a function that receives as input a list and reverses it in place.  That is, your function must
modify the list that the user passed as argument.

## Problem 3: Text Analysis

Write a function that receives a (possibly multi-line) input text and produces a histogram with each of 
the distinct alpha-numeric characters in it (that is, no `.`, spaces, `,`, etc).  For example, if the 
input string is:

```
To be, or not to be: 
that is the question...
Still in 2020
```
your function should print the following *justified* histrogram:

```
t |********
o |*****...
b |**......
e |****....
r |*.......
n |***.....
h |**......
a |*.......
i |****....
s |***.....
q |*.......
u |*.......
l |**......
2 |**......
0 |**......
```

Note the dots `.` after the asteriks that define the histogram profile; these reach the same width than
the maximum frequency of any character.
